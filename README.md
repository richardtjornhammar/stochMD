# Stochastic Molecular Dynamics!

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/richardtjornhammar/stochMD.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/richardtjornhammar/stochMD)

This is a molecular dynamics package supporting grand canonical simulations of
systems with bonded and non-bonded interactions. The velocity re-scaling for the
temperature coupling is stochastic.

# Build 

To build the program issue the command:

```
gcc src/*.c -lm -o stochMD
```
